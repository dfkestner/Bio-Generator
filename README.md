# Bio Generator

  ## Description

  A command-line tool that allows users to generate an HTML bio for an immortal being who conquers worlds. The prompts ask the user for their GitHub username, LinkedIn URL, hobbies, and asks if they have pets (which will be listed as familiars in the generated text). This CLI also uses the 'when' function to display different questions if the user indicates they have no pets, one pet, or multiple pets, and generates the appropriate HTML text based on the user's response.
